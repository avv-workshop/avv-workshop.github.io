<h1>AVVision Special Session (ICAS'21)</h1>

<h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
With a number of breakthroughs in autonomous system 
technology over the past decade, the race to commercialize
self-driving cars has become fiercer than ever. 
The integration of advanced sensing, computer vision,
signal/image processing, and machine/deep learning 
into autonomous vehicles enables them to perceive
the environment intelligently and navigate safely. 
Autonomous driving is required to ensure safe, reliable, and efficient 
automated mobility in complex uncontrolled 
real-world environments. 
Various applications range from automated transportation
and farming to public safety and environment exploration. 
Visual perception is a critical component of autonomous driving. 
Enabling technologies include: a) affordable sensors that 
can acquire useful data under varying environmental conditions,
b) reliable simultaneous localization and mapping, 
c) machine learning that can effectively handle varying 
real-world conditions and unforeseen events, as well as 
“machine-learning 
friendly” signal processing to enable more effective 
classification and decision making, and d) resilient and robust platforms that can withstand 
adversarial attacks and failures. 
The Autonomous Vehicle Vision (AVVision) Special Session will cover all these topics. 
Research papers are solicited in, but not limited to, 
the following topics:
<p>
     
<p>
&#8226 3D road/environment reconstruction and understanding;<br>
&#8226 Mapping and localization for autonomous cars;<br>
&#8226 Semantic/instance driving scene segmentation and semantic mapping;<br>
&#8226 Self-supervised/unsupervised visual environment perception;<br>
&#8226 Car/pedestrian/object/obstacle detection/tracking and 3D localization;<br> 
&#8226 Car/license plate/road sign detection and recognition;<br>
&#8226 Driver status monitoring and human-car interfaces;<br>
&#8226 Deep/machine learning and image analysis for car perception;<br>
&#8226 Adversarial domain adaptation for autonomous driving;<br>
&#8226 On-board embedded visual perception systems;<br>
&#8226 Bio-inspired vision sensing for car perception;<br>
&#8226 Real-time deep learning inference.<br>
