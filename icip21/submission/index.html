<!-- 

    <p><b>Submissions are handled through the EasyChair submission system:
        <br> 
        <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=ieeeicas21#">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=ieeeicas21#</a></b>

        
    </p>
        




    <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
   
        <p>

Prospective authors are invited to submit full-length papers (up to 4 pages for technical content including 
figures and possible references, and with one additional optional 5th page containing only references) 
via the IEEE ICAS 2021 conference website. Manuscripts should be original (not submitted/published 
anywhere else) and written in accordance with the standard double-column SPS IEEE conference format.
<br>
<br>
IEEE ICAS 2021 requires that each accepted paper be presented by one of the authors in-person at 
the conference site according to the schedule to be published. Any paper accepted into the 
technical program, but not presented on-site will be withdrawn from the official proceedings archived on IEEE Xplore.
</p>


<h2>IEEE ICAS 2021 will be using IEEE XploreÂ® Open Preview!</h2>
<p>
Maximize the visibility of your work via early free access: All papers accepted to IEEE ICAS 2021 
will be published on IEEE Xplore through Open Preview, and will be freely accessible and 
downloadable by all in final format prior to conclusion of the conference
<br>
<br>
ICAS 2021 will be publishing all accepted papers as Open Preview, a new IEEE program designed to 
increase speed to market, allow for accelerated access to research, as well as increase in visibility 
of the conference publication. Open Preview allows conference proceedings to be available in 
the IEEE Xplore digital library, free of charge to all customers, one month before the conference 
until the conference ends. During this time, all papers will be available via the conference mobile app and on IEEE Xplore.
<br>
<br> 
After the conference is over, the conference proceedings will no longer be open to all through the IEEE Xplore 
Open Preview and your ability to access the proceedings will depend on your 
own subscription or the subscription of your organization/school to IEEE Xplore.
